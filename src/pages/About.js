                <p>Roya Developments has always been crafting a space with intention and care, where each tailored element speaks to the story and needs of the dwellers within it. Since the company was founded in 2007, a name was made for itself for its genuine approach to creating inclusive, contemporary spaces that fuse timeless-ness and innovation within their many projects across Egypt.</p>
                <p>Our wide portfolio of projects consists of Telal North Coast which is dotted with exquisite penthouses, chalets and villas, with unique themes and d√©cor to match the signature lifestyle of each of its inhabitants, replete with private lagoons, health clubs and upscale restaurants. Its newest extension on the same stretch is Telal Soul, perched on the Alexandrian Matrouh Coastal road.</p>
                <p>Telal El Sokhna, meanwhile, faces the unspoiled crystal waters on the longest beach in Ain El Sokhna, everyone's quick and easy getaway from Cairo's bustle. Its resplendent chalets are carved into the natural elevation of the land and the winding, car-free pathways allow for an immersive connection to nature. In the Cairo metropolis, Stone Park and The Hills New Cairo both are located in prime locations, being navigable from many of the city's hotspots without compromising Roya's sense of tranquility: state-of-the-art apartments, duplexes, penthouses and villas are nestled against a backdrop and greenery.</p>
                <p>Through its varied destinations, the conscious, integrated design present throughout shows how Roya Developments views each project less as a commodity and more as an aspiration.</p>
